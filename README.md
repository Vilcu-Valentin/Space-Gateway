# Space-Gateway

Main File Name: POO_Project_v2.cpp

Theme: Simulator [Space Gateway]

Classes: 

-FuelCell: It is used to store the main game data and perform calculations for the gameplay
 
-Elements: This is an abstract class used as a base class for inheriting common behaviours and variables
-Fluxium: This class is used to store and perform specialised calculations for the "Fluxium" : Element
-Moderators: This class is also used to store and perform specialised calculations for the other Elements

This game is still an early version of a simulator in which you will be able to create and test different fuels for a sci-fi reactor. Currently you can create a Fuel Cell using the main fuel "Fluxium", and 5 different moderators that can help you achieve an optimised fuel. You will have to balance things like power output, stability, radiation and price. Each of this paramaters affect one another. The game has an easy, simple interface with very simple controls that allows you to change the settings.


Next Update:
In the future the game's calculations and mathematics will be changed to achieve a more engaging experience and more true-to-life relationships between the elements.
Also more settings and abilities will be added to expand on the currently simplistic gameplay.

The biggest future update will be the reactor simulation in which you will be able to test the fuel that you make, allowing more settings and features into the game.
